                <p>My first memory as a child is playing with airplane toys in the yard with the neighbor when I was 3.
                    The only job I ever wanted to do growing up was to fly. 
                    This is the one thing I do that I never want to give up.

                <p>Having snakes isn't really new to me. 
                    I've had a few that I brought home as a child and was told I had to let go.
                    Others were bought at pet stores.
                    To breed them though is something new to me and I hope to continue doing it.
